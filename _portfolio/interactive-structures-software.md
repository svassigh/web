Interactive Structures (V1&V2) is an innovative educational software published by John Wiley & Sons (2008) that utilizes computer-generated models, animation, virtual reality, and audio narration to teach structural analysis and design principles to architecture students. This software received the prestigious American Institute of Architects Research Award and has revolutionized how structural concepts are taught in architectural education through interactive visualization techniques.
