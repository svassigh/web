## Project Overview

As climate change and coastal erosion continue to present formidable challenges to South Florida's ecosystem, fostering innovative approaches to coastal development and seawall construction is imperative. Advanced technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI), real-time sensing, big data analytics, and robotic manufacturing offer opportunities to implement data-driven solutions that minimize infrastructure harm to ecosystems and lead to sustainable development.

This proposal outlines a data-driven design approach to coastal development that leverages advancements in technology to research, develop, and test an innovative interlocking system of modular blocks called **"Biocap"**. The primary goal of the project is to advance the design of shoreline landscapes and concrete seawalls by creating a cohesive and interconnected approach that spans across supratidal and intertidal zones.

By integrating AI-powered optimization software, microclimatic data, innovative materials, robotic fabrication, and testing techniques, the project seeks to invent an adaptive, efficient, and sustainable coastal infrastructure system for marine and estuarine environments.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to promote biodiversity, reduce adverse impacts of concrete use on marine life, and increase shoreline resiliency through the following objectives:

1. **Comprehensive Research**: Conducting research on factors influencing seawall and landscape infrastructure design, including:
   - Storm surge analysis
   - Stormwater management strategies
   - Sediment transport modeling
   - Environmental impacts of concrete seawalls

2. **Data Collection & Analysis**: Collecting and analyzing data to inform design and fabrication of varying Biocap solutions

3. **AI-Powered Optimization**: Applying AI algorithms for system optimization, enabling efficient and adaptive design iterations

4. **Prototype Development**: Constructing and testing prototypes to evaluate their performance for supratidal and intertidal applications

5. **Sustainability Evaluation**: Conducting assessments to evaluate the impact of prototypes on:
   - Biodiversity enhancement
   - Sediment capture efficiency
   - Surface cooling effects
   - Water pollution reduction

6. **Knowledge Sharing**: Enabling information sharing among scientists, community members, and other stakeholders through state-of-the-art visualization techniques
